# Maven-Analysis

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The aim of this project is to determine the top three best selling products and their categories in the Maven Toys Company. Another aim is to find out the location with the highest sales.

The company also wants to know the right time to open a new store and where particularly.

I used Microsoft Power BI to carry out this project by cleaning the raw data, and using appropriate charts, colour for the visualisation.
